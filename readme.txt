== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= I've tried the plugin and it doesn't do what I want, help? =


If you think the plugin doesn't work, please try contacting me and I will endeavour to help. You can either start a forum topic on the [WordPress site](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/readme-generator) or leave a comment on my site on the plugin page [Readme Generator Page](http://www.wordpress.org/plugins/readme-generator).

= How is the Content converted into the readme.txt? =


The plugin by default will copy all the post content into the readme.txt but it tries to convert some HTML markup into 'readme.txt' syntax. Roughly it does the following:


* Convert `<h3>Heading</h3>` into `== Heading ==`
* Convert `<h5>Heading</h5>` into `= Heading =`
* Convert `<ul><li>Item</li></ul>` into ` * Item`
* Convert `<ol><li>Item</li></ol>` into ` 1. Item`
* Convert `<code>Code</code>` into `&#96;Code&#96;`
* Convert `<a href="LINK">Text</a>` into `[Text](LINK)`
* Convert `<em>Text</em>` into `*Text*`
* Convert `<stong>Text</strong>` into `**Text**`


= How is the Plugin header generated? =

You plugin header is generated using the settings that have been entered into the 'Generate Readme File' options box on the page/post that you wish to use as the basis of the readme.txt. These settings are stored with the post/page as metadata, they are saved when you update/create the post.

= Does the plugin generate .pot files automatically? =

If enabled the plugin will *attempt* to find all the '`__()`' and '`_e()`' items in all the php files in the plugin's directory and generate a standard .pot file using the strings that it finds.
It will provide warnings if it finds more than one text-domain, or if the text domain is missing. However the php file parsing is quiet primitive and unmatched braces or quotes will probably confuse it ('()"'). Probably better to use xgettext, if you have it!

= Can you show me some examples? =

The readme file for this plugin was generated using the 'Readme Generator' plugin.

The original post can be seen on my site's [plugin page](/plugins/readme-generator), in your browser select 'view page source' to see the HTML that created it (inside the 'content' div).
You can see the readme.txt file that was generated by downloading the plugin or directly through [this link](/diary/wp-content/plugins/readme-generator/readme.txt).
You can see how Wordpress renders this readme.txt at the Wordpress Plugin repository for the [Readme Generator](http://www.wordpress.org/plugins/readme-generator/) plugin.

This global setting, defines what html element the plugin will use to define the plugin top level headings & sections.

== Translations ==

The plugin comes with translation support but as yet no translations are included. Please refer to the WordPress Codex for more information about activating the translation. If you want to help to translate the plugin to your language, please have a look at the i18n/readme-gen.pot file which contains all definitions and may be used to create a language specific .po file. If you do create a translation please contact me and I will add it to the plugin ready for the next update.
